# deep-learning-challenge


It looks like you've uploaded two Jupyter notebooks for the assignment on Alphabet Soup. I'll guide you through preparing a report based on these files. Let's start with an overview of each section for the report structure.

Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to develop a deep learning model that predicts the success of Alphabet Soup's charitable funding efforts. The goal is to create a model that accurately classifies potential recipients of funding as likely to be successful or unsuccessful, enabling more informed and efficient allocation of resources.

Results
Data Preprocessing
Target Variable(s) for the Model:

The target variable in this analysis is the binary classification label indicating the success of each funding application (e.g., "IS_SUCCESSFUL").
Feature Variable(s) for the Model:

The features include all relevant variables that may influence the success outcome, such as applicant information, funding amount, previous results, and other pertinent factors.
Variables to Remove:

Any columns that do not directly influence the target or serve as predictors, such as IDs, categorical identifiers, or any redundant information, should be excluded from the model.
